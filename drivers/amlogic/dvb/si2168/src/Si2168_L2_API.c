 As from V2.4.1:
   In Si2168_standardName:
    casting returned strings as 'char*'
   In Si2168_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:
    setting value of dvb_t2_num_plp to 0 by default

 As from V2.4.0:
   Added unicable_spectrum_inversion in front-end structure, to handle a possible inversion done by the Unicable ODU
   Using DVB-T2 lock times for T/T2 locks
   Adding Si2168_DD_MODE_PROP_MODULATION_ANALOG enum, to separate SLEEP mode and ANALOG mode in Si2168_L2_switch_to_standard
   In Si2168_L2_switch_to_standard:

  Adding PLP management (for DVB_T2 only).
  When scanning: returning dvb_t2_num_plp if locked in DVB-T2, to allow storing one 'channel' per PLP ID
  When locking in DVB-T2: selecting the required dvb_t2_plp_id
  In Si2168_L2_lock_to_carrier:
   Selecting T2 PLP in 2 steps:
    Before tuning when requested standard is DVB-T2
    After locking if
     1- requested standard is DVB-T
     2- AutoTER is active
     3- locked signal is DVB-T2
  In Si2168_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:
   Closing I2C passthrough when selecting FEF mode
   Managing weak signals in a more explicit way.
  In Si2168_L2_Channel_Seek_End:

   Calling Si2168_L2_TER_FEF when done
  In Si2168_L2_lock_to_carrier:
   Storing plp_id for later statusing (This should become part of DVBT2_STATUS's reply)
  Allowing RDA5815 RSSI (relies on the latest RDA5815 driver)

 As from V2.3.6:
  In Si2168_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:
    removed analog detection part from blind_mode section (not used/not validated)

 As from V2.3.5:
   With fw 0_Cb12 (for ROM1)
   With fw 2_0b3  (for ROM2)
   API change: Added dd_ts_mode.special property field to control TS clock separately from other signals
   Adding L2 context member 'unicable_spectrum_inversion', to manage possible spectrum inversion in Unicable LNB
    (this 'reverts' the SAT spectrum during blindscan and needs to be compensated)
  In Si2168_L2_Channel_Seek_Init:
    When using a Unicable LNB, check unicable_spectrum_inversion to set the dd_mode.invert_spectrum field
  In Si2168_L2_switch_to_standard:
    Adding ATV mode: switching SAT and TER clocks off, sleeping DTV demod.

 As from V2.3.4:
   Compatibility with Si2146/Si2158/Si2178

   In Si2168_L2_Channel_Seek_Init, setting DVB-C, DVB-S and DVB-S2 symbol rates based on scan_status, for proper SR statusing.
   With fw 0_Cb9

  In Si2168_Configure:
   DiSEqC 'DD_SET_REG' removed, as this is now controlled by api->prop->dd_diseqc_freq.freq_hz = 0
    (default 22000, '0' means 'envelop mode'), in Si2168_setupDDDefaults
   ts_err 'DD_SET_REG' removed, as this is now controlled by api->prop->dd_ts_mode.ts_err_polarity, in Si2168_setupDDDefaults

  Added lnb_type in Si2168_L2_Context, to store Unicable status (if compiled with UNICABLE_COMPATIBLE)
    lnb_type can be 'UNICABLE_LNB_TYPE_NORMAL'(default) or 'UNICABLE_LNB_TYPE_UNICABLE'
    (lnb_type becomes 'UNICABLE_LNB_TYPE_UNICABLE' when SiLabs_API_SAT_Unicable_Install succeeds)
    if lnb_type == 'UNICABLE_LNB_TYPE_UNICABLE':
     Tuning   uses both the Unicable LNB and the SAT tuner
     Scanning uses both the Unicable LNB and the SAT tuner
     Locking  uses both the Unicable LNB and the SAT tuner
    Otherwise (lnb_type == 'UNICABLE_LNB_TYPE_NORMAL') the behavior is as before

  Added auto_detect_TER and auto_detect_SAT flags in Si2168_L2_Context, to manage AUTO_DETECT
  Changed Si2168_TerAutoDetect    and Si2168_SatAutoDetect    functions to set   the above flags
  Added   Si2168_TerAutoDetectOff and Si2168_SatAutoDetectOff functions to clear the above flags
  In Si2168_L2_lock_to_carrier:
   Using the above flags to lock with or without AUTO_DETECT, depending on the flags.
  In Si2168_L2_SW_Init:
   auto_detect_TER set by default at '0'
   auto_detect_SAT set by default at '1'
   <porting> Change this if required
  In Si2168_L2_switch_to_standard:
   Removed SAT_AUTO_DETECT setup, as this is now controlled by the auto_detect_SAT flag.

  As from V2.3.3:
   Si2178_FEF_MODE_FREEZE_PIN_SETUP macro changed (in Si2168_Si2178.h) to send CONFIG_PINS command to the Si2178, to complete FEF setup.

  As from V2.3.2:
   with fw 0_Cb9
   In Si2168_Configure:
    Initializing value of api->cmd->dd_ext_agc_sat.agc_2_inv, even when not in use.
     (Some compilers may init this value to a non-0 value, and then the command fails if not explicitely set to a valid value)
    Modified FEF management to match new documentation
   In Si2168_PowerUpWithPatch:
    Calling Si2168_L1_GET_REV to display the final revision informatio following fw download.
   In Si2168_L2_switch_to_standard:
    Setting media earlier , as it is used to select tuner LO parameters
   In Si2168_L2_lock_to_carrier:Si2168_L2_Channel_Seek_Init
    Using DD_STATUS for SAT standards, to allow AUTO_DETECT.
   In Si2168_L2_Channel_Seek_Init:
    scan_sat_config.analog_detect set to 'ENABLED' to speed up SAT scan (faster rejection of analog channels).
   In Si2168_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:
    more explicit trace message in case the timemout limits are hit.
   In Si2168_L2_TER_FEF:
    Revised FEF management to match new documentation.
   Si2168_SatAutoDetect and Si2168_TertAutoDetect corrected (dd_mode.modulation  = Si2168_DD_MODE_PROP_MODULATION_AUTO_DETECT)

 As from 2.3.1:
   In Si2168_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:
    Tracing tune request frequency as read in scan_status.rf_freq, in kHz unit
    front_end->rangeMin properly set for DVB-C blindscan

     TER_TUNER_ATV_LO_INJECTION
     TER_TUNER_DTV_LO_INJECTION
    Setting IQ spectrum inversion depending on SAT tuner and HW design, based on a new macro in SAT tuner files:
     Si2168_SAT_IQ_SPECTRUM_INVERSION
   In Si2168_L2_TER_FEF:
    Optimized settings for FEF management, following tests. This requires new macros in TER tuner files:

   SAT & DVB-C blindscan improved.

 As from 2.2.7:
   With fw 0_Cb7
   Si2168_L2_Channel_Seek_Next modified to allow auto detect in TER and SAT to work no matter which initial standard is selected.
   (With earlier releases, auto detection worked only for DVB-T and DVB-S)
   In Si2168_L2_Infos: TERRESTRIAL_FRONT_END tag used to surround TER lines

 As from 2.2.6:
   corrected RDA58xx AGC inversion (#define Si2168_SAT_AGC_INVERTED in Si2168_RDA58xx.h)
   api->cmd->dd_ext_agc_ter.agc_2_kloop = 18;

 As from 2.2.5:
   corrected FEF flag management
   corrected DVB-T2 statusing in Si2168_L2_Channel_Seek_Next

    adding Si2168_CONFIG_CLKIO & Si2168_DVBT2_TX_ID commands
    adding prop->dd_ts_mode.clk_gapped_en property field

 As from 2.2.2:
   Adding Si2168_L2_TER_FEF function
   in Si2168_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:
     FEF set ON in TER, then set to OFF if locked on DVB-T
     Correcting offset in TER (only valid after retrieving dvbt_status or dvbt2_status)
   in Si2168_L2_switch_to_standard:
     Using Si2168_L2_TER_FEF function to set FEF ('on' only in DVB_T2)

 As from 2.2.1:
  Adding FEF control in flags.
   in Si2168_L2_SW_Init: setting fef_mode variable based on user choice (set in Si2168_Platform_Definition.h) and tuner capabilities.
   in Si2168_L2_switch_to_standard: setting FEF mode depending on the current standard.

 As from 2.2.0:
  in Si2168_Configure: removed LED control (unused)

 As from 2.1.9:
  in Si2168_Configure: Setting all MPs by default at 'disable' when not used.

  As from 2.1.5:
  With fw 0_Cb5

 As from 2.1.4:
  Si2168_0B differentiated from Si2168_10 (Si2168_10 has a much smaller fw to download)

  SCAN_CONFIG replaced by SCAN_SAT_CONFIG and SCAN_TER_CONFIG

 As from 2.1.2:
 Si2168_WAKEUP: compatible with Si2168 export

 As from 2.1.2:
 Si2168_WAKEUP:
  Using api->media to select clock source and freq

  Using Si2168_WAKEUP and returning an error if Si2168_WAKEUP fails
  If Si2168_10_COMPATIBLE: api->partMajorVersion = '1';
 Si2168_LoadFirmware:
  Using "traces suspend" & "traces resume" to avoid too many traces during FW download

 Adding more flags to manage the init phases separately (some TER commands may not execute when in SAT, and vice-versa)
  Si2168_L2_SW_Init:
   front_end->first_init_done     = 0;
   front_end->TER_tuner_init_done = 0;
   front_end->SAT_tuner_init_done = 0;
  Si2168_L2_switch_to_standard:
   Tracing the flags statuses.
   Now performing the TER and SAT init only when using the corresponding media.
   Added more traces and error messages.
   Proper management of Si2168_WAKEUP

 As from 2.1.1:
 (only for ROM1 parts)

 DVB-C blindscan working
 SAT   blindscan working (with AUTO_S_S2)

 In Si2168_L2_switch_to_standard:

 In Si2168_L2_lock_to_carrier:
  calling Si2168_L2_Tune after setting dd_mode.bw, as Si2168_L2_Tune uses this variable to set the tuner bw
  forcing bw to 8 MHz for DVB-C

 As from 2.1.0:
  compatibility with Si2168_A10.
   There is now a need to define Si2168_0A_COMPATIBLE or Si2168_10_COMPATIBLE (or both) to select which version(s) can be used
  In Si2168_L2_switch_to_standard:
   removing error message in case of error during Si2168_L2_Tuner_I2C_Enable,
    as this is expected, depending if the function is called after a HW reset or not.
  In Si2168_L2_Tune:
   Limiting bw to 6 MHz min
   Disabling FEF input in TER tuner (if any) in all 'TER' cases
   Enabling  FEF input in TER tuner (if any) only for DVB-T2
